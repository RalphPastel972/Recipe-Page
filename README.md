- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

First of all, I learnt that I am really bad at estimating!
I estimated I needed 200 minutes for this challenge, but I needed the double to polish everythingâ€¦ and I learnt it takes **very** long to do so

To stick to the design was particularly challenging. I made the conscious choice to deviate from the design regarding the bullets, because the solutions I found were hurting accessibility.

The nutrition table at the bottom was challenging and there were many ways I could approach it. I chose multiple divs over use of table. It worked but I am not sure that was the best solution.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to @dakirzakaria I was incentivised to use better html semantics. Thank you.
